Learning the system

I need to write a bit about myself but I am too lazy to do that. Computer games get in the way as well as the piles of food I like to cook. I did come here to look smart and say to people that my interests are computer development, going to the gym and sky diving but that would be a bit of a lie. To be honest I don't go to the gym, sky dived and as I am on this tutorial never developed anything techie. I spose I have to start somewhere...
